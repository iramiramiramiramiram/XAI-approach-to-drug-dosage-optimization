# XAI-approach-to-drug-dosage-optimization

## Overview
The study conducts a lucid AI (XAI) approach to minimize the drug dosage by the help of machine learning models that pose the perfect dosages and at the same time, do not lose the ability to understand the models' decisions. The initiative focuses on the most critical issue of how health care could be AI-driven but the transparency aspect in AI is the paramount concern. One of the good examples for the transparency one is for drug dosage optimization that is achieved, where both the explanations of the reasons behind the predictions and predictions themselves are important.

## Features

- Explainable AI (XAI) Integration: Implements the XAI approach to ensure transparency in model, allowing health care professionals to trust AI-powered dosage suggestions.
- Optimization of Drug Dosage: Uses ML algos to predict the best dose of the prescribed medicine, ensuring the patient benefits while minimizing side effects.
- Review-Based Prediction of Side Effects: Involves identifying potential side effects based on the pattern of the patients’ reviews and medical files to improve the safety and               effectiveness of the drug dosage.
- Interactive Visualizations: Include features to interactively play with the model’s predictions and explanations to aid the end-users in data interpretation.

## Project Structure

- Data: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in the project.
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that walk through the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and explainability processes.
- Models: Pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
- Visualizations: Includes SHAP plots and other visualizations to help interpret the model's predictions.
